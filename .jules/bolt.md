## Angular Change Detection with WebSockets and cm-chessboard

- **Issue:** WebSockets (`ws.onmessage`) and external libraries like `cm-chessboard` trigger callbacks outside of Angular's zone (`NgZone`). This prevents UI updates when state changes occur within these callbacks, causing issues where times don't tick, analysis explanation doesn't show up, and history doesn't properly update.
- **Solution:**
  - Ensure callbacks from `WebSocket` and `cm-chessboard` events are explicitly run inside `ngZone.run(() => { ... })` and manual Change Detection via `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()` is invoked to force template updates.
  - Run asynchronous polling mechanisms (like `setInterval` for timers) outside Angular using `ngZone.runOutsideAngular` to prevent massive change detection cycles, but wrap the logic mutating the state within the interval with `ngZone.run` or call `detectChanges()`.
- **Note:** In `analysis.ts` and `game.ts`, making these explicit zone updates resolved the UI freeze issues.
